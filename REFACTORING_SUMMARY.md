# Portfolio Refactoring Summary

This document outlines all improvements and refactoring changes made to the portfolio project.

## Overview

The portfolio has been comprehensively refactored with a focus on:
- ✅ **Code Quality & Maintainability** - Improved structure and consistency
- ✅ **Performance** - Optimized CSS and component architecture
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Better mobile/tablet support
- ✅ **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
- ✅ **Reusability** - Extracted common components and patterns
- ✅ **Design System** - Centralized CSS variables and utilities

---

## Phase 1: Design System & CSS Organization ✅

### Created Design System (`src/styles/variables.css`)

**Color Palette:**
- Primary colors with light/dark variants
- Accent colors for CTAs
- Neutral grayscale for text and backgrounds
- Status colors (success, warning, error, info)

**Typography:**
- Font sizes (xs to 5xl): `--font-size-xs` through `--font-size-5xl`
- Font weights: light, normal, medium, semibold, bold
- Line heights: tight, normal, relaxed, loose
- Letter spacing: tight, normal, wide

**Spacing (8px Grid):**
- Consistent scale from `--spacing-xs` (4px) to `--spacing-4xl` (96px)
- Improves alignment and consistency across the design

**Effects:**
- Box shadows: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, inner
- Border radius: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, full
- Transitions: fast (150ms), normal (300ms), slow (500ms)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- xs: 320px | sm: 576px | md: 768px | lg: 992px | xl: 1200px | 2xl: 1400px

**Utility Classes:**
- Flexbox utilities: `.flex`, `.flex-center`, `.flex-between`, `.flex-col`
- Gap utilities: `.gap-sm` through `.gap-xl`
- Text utilities: alignment, weight, size, leading
- Spacing utilities: padding, margin
- Color utilities: text and background colors
- Responsive visibility utilities

### Updated Component CSS Files

**Header (`src/components/header/header.css`)**
- Replaced magic numbers with CSS variables
- Added smooth transitions and animations
- Improved mobile menu with better spacing
- Enhanced focus states for keyboard navigation
- Better shadow and border styling

**Home (`src/components/home/home.css`)**
- Used spacing variables for consistent gaps
- Added wave animation to the greeting emoji
- Improved social icon styling with hover effects
- Better gradient effects on the decorative line
- Enhanced responsive breakpoints (576px added)

---

## Phase 2: Header Component Refactoring ✅

### Enhanced Features (`src/components/header/header.jsx`)

**Active Link Detection:**
- Implemented Intersection Observer API to detect current section
- Dynamically highlights the active navigation link
- Updates as user scrolls without page reload

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- ESC key closes the mobile menu
- Tab navigation support with visible focus indicators
- ARIA labels for semantic accessibility
- `aria-current="page"` on active links

**Improved UX:**
- Click outside menu to close (on mobile)
- Menu auto-closes when link is clicked
- Refactored navigation links as data (DRY principle)
- Fixed HTML attribute (`Name` → `id`)

**Accessibility Improvements:**
- Proper button elements for toggles

- Semantic HTML structure
- Focus-visible styles for keyboard users

---

## Phase 3: New Section Components ✅

---

## Phase 4: Reusable Components ✅

### Section Wrapper (`src/components/common/Section.jsx`)

**Purpose:** Standardize section structure across all sections

**Features:**
- Optional title and subtitle
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Proper scroll margin for fixed header
- Takes children for flexible content

**Usage:**
```jsx
<Section id="about" title="About Me" subtitle="Learn more">
  {content}
</Section>
```

**Purpose:** Consistent, reusable button across the site

**Variants:**
- `primary` - Main CTA button
- `secondary` - Secondary actions
- `outline` - Ghost/hollow buttons

**Sizes:**
- `sm` - Small buttons
- `md` - Medium buttons (default)
- `lg` - Large buttons

**Features:**
- Works as both `<button>` and `<a>` tag
- Supports disabled state
- Focus-visible styles
- Smooth hover animations
- Touch-friendly minimum size

**Usage:**
```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="lg" href="#portfolio">
  View My Work
</Button>
```

## Phase 5: Code Quality & Linting ✅

### Fixed Issues

- Removed unused React imports (Data.jsx, Social.jsx, ScrollDown.jsx)
- Corrected file import case (`Header.css` → `header.css`)
- Applied consistent formatting and naming conventions

### Code Standards
